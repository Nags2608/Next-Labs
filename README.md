Part 2 (Second Question) - 
Note that ordered pairs of real numbers (a,b) a,b∈R form a vector space V. Which of the following is a subspace of V? - 
Ans - The set of pairs (a, a + 1) for all real a

Part 2 - Bonus Points - 
Second Question - Formally, a vector space V' is a subspace of a vector space V if - 
Ans - every element of V′ is also an element of V.

First Question - Being a team member on my first project during my course i had worked on a project.The project was based on predicting crop for farmers based on 
   database i had to work on lot of time on collecting the data from goverment websites and other sources. The main problem was finding the valid data
   from the source. I had even worked a lot of time in cleaning and building the model according to the requirement. Being a team member i was part in 
   trying out different building models for checking different accuracies and finding the best one's. So i cannot justify this as my most difficult problem
   yet but i had put in a lot effort for this project work.
